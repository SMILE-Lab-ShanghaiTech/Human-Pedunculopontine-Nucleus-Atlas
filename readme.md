# Human Pedunculopontine Nucleus Atlas

This repository contains the resources and data related to our paper "Direct localization and delineation of human pedunculopontine nucleus based on a self-supervised magnetic resonance image super-resolution method" [[Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26311)]

## 1. Data

We provide Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space unbiased atlas which includes T1w, QSM, and T1w-QSM hybrid modals along with their corresponding labels. You can download the data from [[Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qVqmx45aEMGHYp07YLOEzTYg0QNqS4Qo/view?usp=share_link)]
